      <h2>The band</h2>
      <p>Justice's Gaspard Augé and Xavier de Rosnay began making music in the early 2000s, 
        and first appeared on Musclorvision's Hits Up to You!, 
        a 2003 compilation of songs intended to sound like Eurovision song contest entries. 
        That year, Justice also remixed Simian's "Never Be Alone" for a college radio song contest; 
        Ed Banger signed the duo and released the single, which eventually became popular in England and Germany as well as France. 
        In 2005, Augé and de Rosnay released Justice's debut single, "Waters of Nazareth." 
        During this time, they also established themselves as prolific remixers, reworking songs for artists including N.E.R.D., 
        Britney Spears, Death from Above 1979, Fatboy Slim, Daft Punk, Franz Ferdinand, and Mr. Oizo while working on their first album. Justice's breakthrough arrived in 2007 with the release of "D.A.N.C.E.," a catchy single with an attention-getting video that featured animated T-shirts. 
        The duo's first album, † (aka Cross), appeared that June. Conceived as a "disco-opera" album, it incorporated samples from hundreds of sources ranging from the Italian prog rock outfit Goblin to more typical dance music. 
        Topping the U.K. and U.S. dance album charts and peaking at number 11 in France, † was certified gold in the U.K. and attained diamond certification for its sales throughout Europe. 
        The album was nominated for Best Electronic/Dance Album at the 50th Grammy Awards, while "D.A.N.C.E." earned a nomination for Best Dance Recording. 
        Justice first met as teenagers in 1996 at a mutual friend's house. 
        Later, Xavier de Rosnay studied graphic design at the École des Arts Décoratifs in Paris and Gaspard Augé attended the École Nationale Supérieure d'Architecture de Versailles, where they graduated in 2005. 
        Before forming Justice, both Xavier and Gaspard were members of an indie rock band called “M!ssile”

        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>Apart from the disco and funk influences of electro house, 
          Justice's style has some heavy metal influence. 
          Justice combines cut-up or slapped basslines with compressed and distorted synth sounds. 
          Each of the studio albums have had an accompanying live tour, 
          with each having its own unique live equipment setup.
          On each side of "Valentine" (a non-functional modular synthesizer prop) are nine stacked Marshall cabinet fronts, 
          adding up to a total of 18. 
          The cabinet stacks are another nonfunctional prop that serve as stage dressing. 
          Their DJ setup previously included two Pioneer CDJ-1000MK3s and a Pioneer DJM800,
           but since the A Cross The Universe release tour, 
           Justice have been using Ableton Live controlled by an AKAI MPD24 and a Pioneer DJM800 for their DJ sets.
           Justice has collaborated with numerous artists including Theophilus London, Uffie and Morgan Phalen. 
           They have also worked with Kanye West on his song “All of the Lights” off his 2010 album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. 
           In addition to that, they have also produced for artists such as Drake, M83 and Kavinsky.
           Justice has been credited with helping to redefine electronic music and influencing a generation of producers. 
           Their single “D.A.N.C.E” was voted number one on Pitchfork's Top 500 Tracks of the 2000s list and they have also been featured on Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest EDM Songs of All Time list. 
           They have won numerous awards including two Grammy Awards for Best Dance/Electronic Album for their albums † (Cross) and Audio, Video, Disco.
